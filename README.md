# Homelab infrastructure config

This repo contains configurations to bootstrap my homelab environment. I am an SRE in my day-job, so I am trying to adhere to the following concepts as much as possible (even though it may seem overkill for a homelab, consider it a fetish):

- Everything as code
- High availability
- Immutability & repeatable builds
